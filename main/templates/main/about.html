             Snap 2 Count is a solution that serves the purpose of classifying various types of U.S. coins such as pennies, dimes, nickels, or quarters and tallies the total value of coins dispersed on a surface. This solution saves time, gas money and energy required to take coins to the supermarket or bank. Most banks no longer provide this service except for a select few. Any machine at a supermarket that calculates coins for you such as Coinstar takes up space in the supermarket and often charges an extra fee for these services.

              Aside from time saving, money saving from extra fees, and added convenience, numerous motives and applications exist for this project. This algorithm can be beneficial for children learning how to count money. The project can also be useful for the elderly with impaired vision or poor memory.

              Additionally, our project emphasizes the importance of how difficult and essential object counting is in many computer vision applications. Our focus is to have a well designed, accurate algorithmic producing as little error as possible so that it can be used by people for their computer vision applications that require counting and image classifying. Our method uses an approach that has never been done before by combining the use of many existing computer vision techniques into one technique for a more accurate algorithm.
